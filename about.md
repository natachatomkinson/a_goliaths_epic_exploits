I am of the opinion that I have always been not bad at handling weapons of all kinds. 
 
My younger brother joined the army of some lame king as soon as he could.
As I tend to not care much for nobility I chose better – but later, as my brother is happy to remind me – to sell my skills to the highest bidder.
I have however grown tired of killing for no reason save money.
I have decided to quit my promising career to further my personal quest.

I knew nothing of magic until a battle against a supposedly better opponent than myself.
They were about to deal what would have been a fatal blow.
In this instant, I swear I saw before they dealt how they were going to deal it.
And when I say 'saw', I mean I had nothing short of a vision. 
I counterattacked accordingly and passed out – to wake up in my camp being healed.
I know not what happened to my opponent. 

From that day, I had to get better than the other wizards in my army. 
I learnt through tricks and bruises.
I am not sure how I feel about magic.
