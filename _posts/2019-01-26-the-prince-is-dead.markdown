He is lying on the floor. 
Kassil has dealt the final blow to Lorentz.
As one of her wolves pokes the Prince's side, Lord Usk, finally avenged, falls to the ground.
Dead too. For the second time.

I feel defeated. In the course of this battle, I have lost hope for the first time in a long time.
Right before he died, I asked Lorentz, the Prince "Are you Lorentz?".
Two voices answered. Only one of them is dead, I wager.
If I was religious, I would pray for his soul.

Lorentz had just run his rotten blade through the body of his father and broken havoc on his land.
Full disclosure, we helped him.

To be entirely fair to Kassil, Ryden and myself, we did not know.
But when all is said and done, will it matter?

Shoulders hunched, I walk out of the throne room to the pyre.
The King is dead. Murdered by his son or at least at the hand of his son.
Other corpses have been left there to rot.
Purple flames lap at their bodies as monstrous thirsty creatures would.
I put my hands on this abomination made of wood and stone.
I close my eyes and concentrate as hard as I can.
When I do, it seems time halts. Everything around me comes through as muffled.
Images come to my mind â€“ sharp, blunt, with a faint acrid smell.
A tower, demonic undead, grieving souls begging for rest.

Abavius is where I left him, up the stairs, on another plane.
His safe and comfortable library a shelter to the Queen and her children.
I tell him of the nature of the pyre: a beacon meant to amplify the power of something darker than necromancy, feeding on souls.

We head back down the stairs. In the throne room, the Prince's dreaded weapon is still on the floor. 
Kassil has wrenched it free from an awfully melted hand. She was careful to wrap her hand in furs.

We managed to kill some wights. We did.
We managed to protect part of the royal family.
Abavius teleported and I went for the ride, while Kassil, Ryden and Usk scaled the walls.
The plan was to get the King and all out and deal with the Prince later.
We did not know we had already run out of time.

What an odd bunch thrown together. Unnaturally united to fight a most unnatural cause.
A druid of the circle of twilight, a rogue drow, a wizard Goliath and a ... revenant.
Don't tell Kassil I wrote this down in my journal. 
She is probably hoping for this memory to have died down with the Prince.

By the end of the fight, I am drained of all will. 
I don't think I could have mustered one more spell.

When Arnulf asks us if we've won, I can't help but look at my shoes.
