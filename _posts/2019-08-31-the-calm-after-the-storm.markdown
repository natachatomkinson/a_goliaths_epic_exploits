I'd rather not talk about the sausage casings incident. Not without a good few pints of decent ale in me anyway.

We land on the unfamiliar shores of the Desert of Nume after riding out a storm safely propelled by Cassil – in shark form.
The problem with storms is that unless you're a god, there is not much you can do about them.
Guess they are good reminders of our humanity and the vanity of our self-delusions. I digress.

Upon waking up, we are informed that a member of the sailing crew has disappeared.
Matte is missing along with some supplies. He has been with the crew for the past 5 years.
Average in height and build, he has an anchor tattoo on his arm and is a dark-skinned human.

As the now canon "investigation team", we offer our services to find the whereabouts of the sailor.
Ryden seems also determined to pick up some wood to fix up the boat.

We follow extremely clear footprints in the sand. 
They lead us – uninterrupted – to an extremely narrow path, down a closed gorge.  
I didn't fall off the turnip wagon so let me tell you something. 
I can see an obvious trap setting when I see one. And as is often the case, I was not wrong.


It reminded me of this time when my company was tracking down this monk gnome.
He led us straight in what we referred to afterwards as the ultimate throat-slitter.
I think we lost 4 companions that day. To a rookie's mistake. 
I am sure you'd like to hear the specifics and let me put your mind at ease, I will tell you the story, I will write the story as a footnote to this one.
