The laird of the castle is polite and quite friendly. So friendly that after an intensive research effort, he offers us some very quaffable whisky.
It's just as well as Cassil comes back from the little fishing village where a *keen* bookseller has also been telling her of the local lore.

We share our new-found knowledge. The island to the North-West of the island we are on has housed an abbey dedicated to Umberley the goddess of the sea for the last couple of centuries – maybe longer, who can know for sure?

The laird understanding that our next stop will be the abbey warns us against useless superstitions and old folks' tales.
He also asks us a favour. He would like to build a lighthouse to help the village main trade prosper again. We agree as a gesture of gratefulness.  
As we take our leave, the guard, butler and general chamberlain stops up. He tells us of the dock – a shrine dedicated to Umberley.
Sailors of all trade used to drop small offerings to stay in the goddess's good books. A few years ago, a storm arose and broke the very same dock where the shrine stood.

We walk back to where Kwalish and the airship are. Kwalish – who mans the ship at all times – refuses to tell Ryen how to free the air elementals powering the beautifully useful contraption. I silently note that Kwalish just called us his "companions". I wonder if he can drink spirits in this new body of his.

We have a rough idea of where the abbey is but no maps so we rely entirely on Kwalish's common sense and navigational skills.
He drives us safely to what looks like the spot. A storm rages – localised just above the abbey. This doesn't smell exactly natural.
