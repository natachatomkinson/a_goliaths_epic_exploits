The laird of the castle is polite and quite friendly. So friendly that after an intensive research effort, he offers us some very quaffable whisky.
It's just as well as Cassil comes back from the little fishing village where a *keen* bookseller has also been telling her of the local lore.

We share our new-found knowledge. The island to the North-West of the island we are on has housed an abbey dedicated to Umberley the goddess of the sea for the last couple of centuries – maybe longer, who can know for sure?

The laird understanding that our next stop will be the abbey warns us against useless superstitions and old folks' tales.
He also asks us a favour. He would like to build a lighthouse to help the village main trade prosper again. We agree as a gesture of gratefulness.  
As we take our leave, the guard, butler and general chamberlain stops up. He tells us of the dock – a shrine dedicated to Umberley.
Sailors of all trade used to drop small offerings to stay in the goddess's good books. A few years ago, a storm arose and broke the very same dock where the shrine stood.

We walk back to where Kwalish and the airship are. Kwalish – who mans the ship at all times – refuses to tell Ryen how to free the air elementals powering the beautifully useful contraption. I silently note that Kwalish just called us his "companions". I wonder if he can drink spirits in this new body of his.

We have a rough idea of where the abbey is but no maps so we rely entirely on Kwalish's common sense and navigational skills.
He drives us safely to what looks like the spot. A storm rages – localised just above the abbey. This doesn't exactly scream natural.
If we believe the keen village seller, a green sea monster lurks in the depths nearing the village and the abbey reclaiming souls at leisure.
As we do not particularly wish to make their acquaintance with other pressing matters at hands, we jump on the shore through the airship feather-fall equipped door.
Our landing on the rocky slope is gentle as can be. Cassil has spotted a shimmering green shape in the water and a small and wrecked boat not too far from where we now stand.
We decide to investigate the wreck for bodies we could bring back to the village. 

"What are you doing here?"
I think it must have been the sound of the crashing waves that covered the steps approaching behind us.
The tone is threatening and despite the orders, we turn to find ourselves facing a human, an halfling and an elf.
