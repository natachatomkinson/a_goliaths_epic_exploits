* Spring
• go upstream – towards the source of the river
* river is very wide ++ > 1 mile
* guard towers on the other side
* => Reusinia is a young country
* barbarians used to raid from North of the river
* Guardian Princes lived south of the river
* Queen Reus took an army, killed barbarians took hold of the South => Reusinia
* Cas"seal" is convinced to take a bath – skinny dip
* Ryden takes basin bath
* At night, Cassil's Ryden's turn are ok
* Lania gets the encounter - unfortunately she doesn't have dark vision, tough
* Attacked by 4 by surprise
* Get severe beating for the first few turns but then the tide turns
* 2 flee – supposedly
* We rest and continue
* Arrive at mountains, up up narrower, colder
* Lania fails to find entrance
* Cassil finds entrance of cave – bummer 
* It's a winding maze going underground, warmer.

Riddle of the door with 4 holes:
1. I never rest, my actions can be seen but not myself
2. I am the insatiable hunger, warden of the night but destroyer also
3. 3 lives have I. Light enought to float, gentle enough to soother, hard enough to destroy
4. Mountains mighty, meadows sweet, my solid reassurance holds them all

Lock:
* Ryden picks it

- Silence, this is a library written behind the door

People greet us with "It's been a while since we had visitors"
