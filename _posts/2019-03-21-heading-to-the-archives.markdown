A lovely spring day is unfolding as we happily ride along the river.
It's not raining, we are not fighting. 
Maybe my bruises and my hungover will get a chance to heal.

The plan is to go upstream and figure out the way to enter the archives.
I am not too hopeful about signposts.

The river is wide and glints in the sun – in a very enticing way.
On the other side, we spot guard towers.

Cassil goes on to explain that Reusinia is a young country.
Barbarians from North of the river used to raid the South - where the Guardian Princes lived.
Once upon a time, Queen Reus took an army, killed the barbarians and took dominion of the South.
Her new united land took the name of Reusinia.

I dare Cas"seal" into taking a bath – she takes the huff and the bait.
I drop my clothes and gear to the ground and join the druid in her endeavours.
Ryden – awkward as ever – sort of crouches and splashes his body about.

At night, Cassil and Ryden take the first turns. They can see in the dark and frankly I love to sleep.
Unfortunately when my turn comes, I can't see much and 4 brigands – I think – take me by surprise.
The advantage they get is worrying, I obviously defeat them but forget about healing bruises.
Two of them manage to escape, small bait, not worth running after. I'd like to reiterate I love to sleep.
We rest again and continue our journey.

As we ride up, I feel more and more in my element. It almost smells like home.
We stop where we think the entrance should be and start searching.
I think I might have suffered a concussion as nothing seems to stick out.
Cassil is successful and leads us down a winding maze.

We go further underground, it gets warmer until we find a mystifying door.
It presents us with a riddle in an ancient language along with 4 holes:

1. I never rest, my actions can be seen but not myself
2. I am the insatiable hunger, warden of the night but destroyer also
3. 3 lives have I. Light enought to float, gentle enough to soother, hard enough to destroy
4. Mountains mighty, meadows sweet, my solid reassurance holds them all

We solve the riddle and another door with a physical lock this time is revealed.
Ryden picks it – didn't know he could do that.

"Silence, this is a library" is written behind the door

We find ourselves facing a number of what look like scholars who greet us: "It's been a while since we had visitors".
I bet.
